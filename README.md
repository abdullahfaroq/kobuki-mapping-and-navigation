Socially Aware Mobile Robot
Overview
This project focuses on the development of a socially aware mobile robot capable of navigating dynamic human environments while adhering to social norms. The robot utilizes advanced algorithms for navigation, human detection, and social behavior modeling, aiming to improve interactions between humans and robots.

Features
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM): Efficiently map and localize the robot in dynamic environments.
Social Navigation: Navigate through human-populated areas while respecting personal space and social cues.
Human Detection: Recognize and follow humans, adapting to social behaviors.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): User-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the robot.
Integration with ROS: Utilizing ROS for robust and flexible robot control.
